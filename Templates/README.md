**Clarity:** Write clear, concise content that is easily understood by students, instructors, and administrators. Avoid jargon unless necessary, and define technical terms.

**Professionalism:** Maintain a professional tone throughout all documentation. Avoid casual language, slang, or unnecessary informality.

- Contact information and resources

**What to Preserve:**
- Overall document structure and section order
- Heading levels and formatting
- Table structures and layouts
- Professional tone and style
- Markdown formatting conventions

**What to Remove:**
- Instructions sections at the end of templates
- Placeholder text in [brackets]
- Unused optional sections (if applicable)
- Template-specific notes and comments
