# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is this repository?

This repository serves as the centralized hub for all training calendars, course schedules, and program timelines across the International Cybersecurity and Digital Forensic Academy (ICDF Academy). It provides organized access to training materials for students, instructors, and administrators across all schools and programs.

### Who can access this repository?

The repository is private and accessible only to authorized users including enrolled students, instructors, program coordinators, and academy administrators. Access is granted through GitHub account permissions managed by the academy administration.

### How is the repository organized?

The repository follows a four-level hierarchical structure: School → Program → Cohort (Batch) → Phase. This organization allows easy navigation to specific training calendars and materials based on your school, program, enrollment batch, and current training phase.

## Navigation Questions

### How do I find my training calendar?

Navigate through the repository structure by following these steps: First, locate your school directory under the Schools folder. Second, find your specific program within the school. Third, access your cohort or batch year. Finally, select your current phase to view the training calendar and related materials.

### What if I cannot find my program?

If your program is not listed in the repository, it may be under development or scheduled for a future release. Contact your program coordinator or the academy administration for information about when your program materials will be available.

### How do I navigate between different levels?

Each README file at every level contains navigation links to parent directories and subdirectories. You can use these links to move up to higher levels or down to more specific content. The main repository README provides direct links to all schools and major programs.

## Content Questions

### What information is included in training calendars?

Training calendars include comprehensive information about each phase of training, including course schedules with dates, course codes and names, unit credits, learning outcomes, assessment methods, case studies where applicable, and contact information for coordinators.

### Are case studies included for all programs?

Case studies are included in programs where practical application of investigative or analytical skills is essential. The Advanced Cybercrime Investigations program, for example, includes five detailed case studies in Phase 2. Other programs may include different types of practical exercises or projects.

### How often are training calendars updated?

Training calendars are updated as needed to reflect schedule changes, course modifications, or program enhancements. All updates are tracked in the CHANGELOG.md file with version numbers and dates. Students and instructors are notified of significant changes through official academy communication channels.

## Technical Questions

### How do I clone this repository?

Use the GitHub CLI command: `gh repo clone icdfa/icdf-training-calendars` or use Git with: `git clone https://github.com/icdfa/icdf-training-calendars.git`. Ensure you have the necessary access permissions before attempting to clone the repository.

## Contribution Questions

### How can I contribute to this repository?

Follow the guidelines outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file. The general process involves cloning the repository, creating a feature branch, making your changes following the established structure and naming conventions, committing with clear messages, and submitting a pull request for review.

### Who reviews and approves contributions?

All contributions are reviewed by repository maintainers and relevant program coordinators to ensure accuracy, consistency, and compliance with academy standards. The review process typically takes one to three business days depending on the scope of changes.

### What types of contributions are accepted?

Accepted contributions include new training calendars for approved programs, updates to existing calendars with verified information, corrections to errors or outdated information, improvements to documentation and navigation, and enhancements to repository structure following established guidelines.

## Program-Specific Questions

### What is the difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2?

Phase 1 typically covers foundational concepts and core knowledge in the program area, providing students with essential skills and theoretical understanding. Phase 2 builds upon Phase 1 with advanced topics, practical application through case studies or projects, and specialized skills development. Some programs may include additional phases beyond Phase 2.

### How long does each phase last?

Phase duration varies by program and is specified in each training calendar. For example, Phase 2 of the Advanced Cybercrime Investigations program lasts eight weeks with approximately 240 hours of training. Consult your specific program's training calendar for exact duration and time commitment.

### Can I access materials from phases I am not currently enrolled in?

Access to phase materials is typically restricted to students currently enrolled in that phase. However, students who have completed earlier phases retain access to those materials for reference. Contact your program coordinator if you need access to materials from phases you have not yet reached.

## Administrative Questions
